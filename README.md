# Building a secure large volume private data infused AI application using RAG and LLM with Hands-On Project

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has continued to push boundaries and reshape our understanding of what machines can achieve. One of the most exciting advancements in recent years is the GenerativeAI or GenAI. Secure GenAI can be achieved through the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This integration promises to elevate AIâ€™s capabilities, providing more secure, accurate, contextual, and meaningful interactions.

## Understanding Large Language Models
LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, are built using deep learning techniques and are trained on vast public datasets obtained from the internet. They excel in understanding and generating human-like text based on context and patterns learned during their training. These models are proficient in various applications, including language translation, creative text generation, text summarization, and conversational agents. Since they do not have access to private business data, they will not work solutions that require the semantics of private data. The solution is RAG Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

## The Concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
RAG represents a significant step forward by combining the strength of LLMs with a private knowledge base. It allows the model to retrieve relevant information from vast private, secure data repositories, thereby enhancing the context and accuracy of generated responses. This process involves two main steps: retrieval and generation.

Retrieval: The model queries an external database to retrieve relevant documents or data points.
Generation: The retrieved information is then used to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
This hybrid approach ensures that the AI can provide more factual and precise answers, even for private, niche or specialized topics.
